Apple IIe - I wrote my first program on an Apple IIe. It was in year ten at a Melbourne high school. I was immediately hooked.

Shortly after my parents bought me a Commodore 128. I had an amber monochrome monitor, disk drive and a dot matrix printer too.

My first IT purchase was a book titled: Commodore 64 Programmer's Reference Guide. It's one of the few memorabilia I kept from my teens. A family friend gave me another book titled: A Commodore 64 mikrogep kezelese es programozasa. It was from Hungary.

I played Frogger a lot, unfortunately it was terribly slow to load from a casette tape. I figured out a way to save the entire game to a floppy disk. I was staring at assembly code for days.

# toyrouter - a linux router stripped to bare essentials 
*September 2020*

Bare bones Linux WAN to LAN router.

Only uses busybox and iptables in user space. Built as a programming exercise, but functional. Probably the simplest router you will find.

Designed to install over Ubuntu by creating a new entry in the Ubuntu boot menu. Uses overlayfs without modifying the Ubuntu user space. 

Retains the easy installation and hardware compability of Ubuntu with the simplicity of a busybox based userspace.

I got the inspiration from [The Ars guide to building a Linux router from scratch](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/04/the-ars-guide-to-building-a-linux-router-from-scratch/).
I decided that I wanted something that is even more from "scratch".

# bminus - a c subset compiler
*November 2014*

Generates assembler or javascript. It can compile itself from within a web browser.

Straight forward design. BNF rules map to one function in general. Code is generated straight from a recursive parser.

The code generator module can be replaced independently to support multiple output targets.


- [Hello world](bminus/hello-world)
- [Language syntax](bminus/language-syntax)
- [Online compiler](bminus/online-compiler)
- [Source code](bminus/source-code)
- [Building the source](bminus/building-the-source)

<br>

*September 2020*

Compiles under Ubuntu 20.04. Replaced Oracle jjs with NodeJs.
